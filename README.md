# Horse-Race-Prediction
Project uses machine learning to predict horse race winners (win/place) from 1990-2020 data. It involves data cleaning, analysis, and exploring models to make accurate predictions.

workflow:
1.Gather Data: Races (1990-2020), Horses, Pre-race info (odds, ratings)

2.Clean & Prepare Data: Handle missing values, normalize data, encode categories.

3.Craft New Features: Combine existing data for performance metrics, trends.

4.Merge Datasets: Combine race & horse data for comprehensive analysis.

5.Summarize Data: Calculate statistics for key race and horse features.

6.Visualize Data: Use charts (histograms, scatter plots) to explore distributions.

7.Analyze Correlations: Identify relationships between features using correlation matrix.

8.Evaluate Feature Importance: Rank features based on their influence on outcomes.

9.Select Machine Learning Models: Explore models like Regression, Random Forest, etc.

10.Perform Cross-Validation: Test model performance on unseen data.

11.Address Imbalanced Data: Use SMOTE, under-sampling, or class weight adjustments.

12.Select Features: Refine the model with techniques like RFE or regularization.

13.Tune Model Hyperparameters: Optimize model parameters for best performance.

14.Train the Model: Train the chosen model on the prepared dataset.

15.Evaluate Model Performance: Assess prediction accuracy on a separate test set.

16.Refine Model (if needed): Iterate on feature selection, hyperparameters based on evaluation.

17.Predict Race Outcomes: Use the final model to predict win/place for new races.

18.Analyze Predictions: Identify patterns and insights from the predictions.

19.Interpret Results: Understand the factors influencing the model's predictions.

20.Present Findings: Communicate the project's workflow, results, and potential applications.

*Outcome:

The project outcome cannot be definitively stated as it is still in the planning stages. However, the project aims to achieve the following:

-Developed Model: A machine learning model trained on historical data (1990-2020) to predict horse race outcomes (win or place).

-Improved Prediction Accuracy: The model should outperform random chance and potentially existing prediction methods for horse racing.

-Identified Key Features: The project aims to identify the most significant factors influencing race outcomes based on data analysis.

-Techniques for Imbalanced Data: The project should explore and implement techniques to handle the potential imbalance of winning vs. losing outcomes in the data.

-Insights into Horse Racing: By analyzing the data and building the model, the project may reveal new insights into factors affecting horse racing outcomes.

It's important to remember that horse racing has inherent unpredictability, so the model's predictions won't be perfect. However, the project aims to create a valuable tool for informed decision-making when it comes to horse racing.
